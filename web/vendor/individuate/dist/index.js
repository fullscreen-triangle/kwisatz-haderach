/**
 * Public API. `ask()` is the fix for the failure this package exists to
 * solve (paper §1.1): a retrieval system that hands back the top-matching
 * passage is answering a question ("what tokens overlap the query") that is
 * provably not the one the caller asked ("what does this mean, to me, right
 * now" — Thm 3.4). `ask()` never returns a bare passage. It always returns a
 * `status` that is honest about grounding strength (Thm 6.4, Thm 6.6–6.7),
 * and a `claim` that is individuated against the caller's own persistent
 * receiver graph (Thm 4.9), not a content-similarity score.
