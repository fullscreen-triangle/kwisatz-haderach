/**
 * Causal propagation table (paper §5, Def 5.3, Thm 5.4). A static
 * knowledge-index lookup and a generative multi-hop answer are ONE object
 * evaluated at two settings of the process argument: the trivial process
 * (single rest-contact) returns the resting catalogue cell; a nontrivial
 * process returns the accountable terminus of a propagation walk. There is
 * no architectural seam between "look it up" and "reason it out" (Remark 5.5).
 *
 * Thm 5.6 (path opacity): admissibility depends only on the terminal claim
 * matching the target — interior steps are unconstrained and a strange
 * intermediate step is not, by itself, evidence of failure (Remark 5.7).
 * Only non-convergence (the walk never reaching the target) is a failure.
