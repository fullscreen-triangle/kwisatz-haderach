/**
 * Catalytic composition and coherence (paper §6, Def 6.1–6.3, Thm 6.2, 6.4).
 *
 * A catalyst is any independently-sourced retrieval/reasoning step that
 * shifts alignment toward a target claim. Composing catalysts follows a
 * multiplicative law (Thm 6.2): repeating one source saturates strictly
 * below 1 and slower than diversifying (Cor 6.3) — this is *forced* by the
 * law, not a tuning heuristic.
 *
 * Coherence (Thm 6.4): a linear chain or a 2-cycle of mutual support is
 * never robust to removing one member. Only a strongly-connected triangle
 * (>=3 catalysts, each supported by the other two at θ>1/2) survives the
 * loss of any single member. This is enforced structurally below: a claim
 * can only be marked "grounded" once a real triangle exists.
