/**
 * Water-filling attention allocation (paper §8.2, Def 8.6, Thm 8.10). Under
 * the diminishing-returns axiom (Ax 8.7: every gain profile is concave), the
 * value-maximising split of a finite attention budget across competing
 * scenes is characterised by a single price p*: marginal gain is equalised
 * across every attended scene, and a scene is dropped if its first unit of
 * attention already returns less than p* (KKT stationarity of the
 * Lagrangian, solved here by bisection on the price).
 *
 * Remark 8.11: this is exactly as strong as Ax 8.7 and no stronger — a
 * non-concave (increasing-returns) gain profile breaks the guarantee, and
 * the true optimum there concentrates the whole budget on one scene instead
 * of dividing it. Callers with such a scene should not use this solver
 * (Experiment 9's second case in the paper demonstrates the >40x gap).
